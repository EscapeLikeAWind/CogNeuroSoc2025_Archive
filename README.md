# Abstract
Visual search efficiency improves with repetition as target templates shift from working to long-term memory. The anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right posterior
parietal cortex was reported to enhance working memory. However, the tDCS-stimulating effect of different cortical sites on the interaction between memory systems and attention during visual
search remains unexplored. This study examines how tDCS influences the interaction between working memory, long-term memory, and attention during visual search. Nineteen participants
(aged 18–35) completed a visual search task requiring memory of colored cues (red or green) and Landolt-C shapes, repeated across trials. Participants received 20 minutes of 2.0 mA anodal
tDCS over the left or right posterior parietal cortex (PPC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), or sham stimulation, with sessions separated by at least 48 hours. Behavioral results
showed no significant difference in hit rates between real and sham stimulation, though left PPC stimulation modestly reduced reaction times. EEG data revealed that the right DLPFC
stimulation enhanced contralateral delay activity in early trial repetitions, supporting improved visual working memory capacity. Both right DLPFC and left PPC amplified the N2pc component
in mid-sequence trials, indicating enhanced attention guided by memory templates. Uniquely, the right PPC stimulation increased late positive complex activity during early and mid-repetition
phases, suggesting facilitation of working-to-long-term memory transfer and highlighting functional lateralization within PPC. These findings underscore anatomically specific roles of PPC and
DLPFC in modulating memory and attention processes during visual search.
